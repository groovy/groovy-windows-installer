Installed Versions
==================
This file contains the versions (or dates) of all the components installed by the 
Windows Installer.


Groovy
------
Binary Version: 1.8.0
Doc Version:    1.8.0

Native Launcher (all in bin)
----------------------------
The native launcher is compiled with Cygwin support. In Supplemental you find a directory
"NativeLauncherWithoutCygwinSupport" that contains versions of the native launcher 
compiled without the Cygwin support. If you have any problems with the native launcher 
please try these versions. Also in this directory you'll find the 32- and 64-bit versions
of the launcher in case you need to exchange the installed versions.

bin:
	gant.exe
	gantw.exe
	groovy.exe
	groovyc.exe
	groovyConsole.exe
	groovysh.exe
	groovyw.exe
	java2groovy.exe

32-/64-Bit Version of Java
--------------------------
The installer tries to find out whether a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of Java is installed.
If the installer cannot determine this a 32-bit installation is assumed. Depending on the 
Java version the 32- or 64-bit version of the native launcher is installed. If you change 
the Java installation later, simply copy the respective version of the native launcher to
the bin directory. The mapping is as follows:

groovy.exe  - groovy.exe, groovyc.exe, groovysh.exe, java2groovy.exe
groovyw.exe - groovyw.exe, groovyConsole.exe
gant.exe    - gant.exe
gantw.exe   - gantw.exe

In rare cases the necessary Microsoft C runtime libraries are not installed on the target
computer. As a result the executables won't run. In this case please install the 
libraries after downloading from the correct of following Links:

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120133   "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package"
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120135   "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x64)"
