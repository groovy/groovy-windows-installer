Scriptom-2.0b (dll in bin, jars in lib)
---------------------------------------
jacob.dll Version 1.14-M2
scriptom.jar 2.0b

Additionally you find the directory scriptom in GROOVY_HOME. This directory contains the zipped
examples, the type-library information, the Jacob-1.14-M2-distribution and a Microsoft update (a
redistributable package) for the runtime components of C++ libraries. 

Regarding the Microsoft update: It might be necessary to execute the update to install current
versions of the respective libraries (I think only msvcr80.dll). They should be installed on your 
system already. If you see the following message then you probably don't have the right C++ libraries:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\apps\...\jacob.dll: 
This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. 
Reinstalling the application may fix this problem 

The Jacob-distribution contains a 64-bit version of the jacob.dll, that you can use if you are so
inclined. It might be necessary on a 64-bit Windows with 64-bit Java, but has not been tested yet.

This version of scriptom is found to be quite stable by the developers. The jacob.dll has been
thoroughly tested. This version of scriptom needs Java 1.5.
