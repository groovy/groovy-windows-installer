"The Native Launcher is an executable, that \
in most cases is preferrable to the normal \
launching scripts. If you want file associations, \
than you have to install the native launcher.\

then leave the checkbox in the checked state."

"File Association allows us to define \
a program (in our case groovy) to execute upon \
double click on a file. This means that you can \
execute your groovy programs directly from the explorer.\
You need the native launcher for this.\
\r\n\r\nAn added benefit is that the groovy \
icon is associated with groovy files."
